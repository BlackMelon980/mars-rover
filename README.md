# MARS ROVER ðŸš€

Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet. Develop
an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are understood by the rover.

## Requirements

- You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
- The rover receives a character array of commands.
- Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
- Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
- Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
- Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle,
  the rover moves up to the last possible point, aborts the sequence and reports the obstacle.

## Run the application

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```
mvn quarkus:dev
```

Quarkus will start in development mode as normal, but down the bottom of the screen you should see the following:

```
Press [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [:] for the terminal, [h] for more options>
```

Press r and the tests will start running.\
If you want continuous testing to start automatically you can set
`quarkus.test.continuous-testing=enabled` in **application.properties.**

## Endpoints

## Space

### Initialize the space

values:

- width
- height
- obstaclesCount

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/space/init' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "width": 5,
    "height" : 5,
    "obstaclesCount" : 7
}'
```

### Show space info

```
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/space'
```

## Rover

### Update rover

Values:

- position : { x, y }
- direction: [ N, E, S, W ]

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/rover' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "position" : {
        "x" : 3,
        "y" : 2
    },
    "direction" : "E"
}'
```

### Move rover

Possible values: [ F, B, R, L ]

```
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:8080/rover/move' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '["F","R"]'
```
